# Recognising-Facial-Expression-through-Decision-Trees
A Decision tree is a technique that can be used to represent algorithms. They categorise a given problem using its attributes at every node of the tree by means of tests, or decisions. As the tests move down the tree, they allow narrowing down and classifying a problem into one of many categories, depending on the data set. In the project, we aim to implement a decision tree algorithm that categorises the six basic human expressions, namely: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. By using AU (Action Unit) data as our input, representing the activation/deactivation of visible facial muscle, we can adopt various tests for each node at every level of the tree that will check an attribute for a positive (1) or negative (0) activation and so moving the data further down the tree until they have been classified. By investigating training data and their combination of active or inactive AU attributes, a decision tree will be generated for each of the six expressions. The generated trees will then be tested on test data to evaluate their classification performance. The goal is to be able to classify unseen data into the appropriate human expression accurately.
